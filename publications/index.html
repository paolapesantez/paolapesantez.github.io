Many disciplines in science are moving towards the incorporation of intelligent virtual assistants in multiple scenarios and application domains, and GIScience is not external to this trend since they may be connected to intelligent spatial decision support systems. This article presents a scoping review to indicate relevant literature pertinent to intelligent virtual assistants and their usage of geospatial information and technologies. In particular, the study was designed to find critical aspects of GIScience and how to contribute to the development of virtual assistants. Moreover, this work explores the most prominent research lines as well as relevant technologies/platforms to determine the main challenges and current limitations regarding the use and implementation of virtual assistants in geospatial-related fields. As a result, this review shows the current state of geospatial applications regarding the use of intelligent virtual assistants, as well as revealing gaps and limitations in the use of spatial methods, standards, and resources available in spatial data infrastructures to develop intelligent decision systems based on virtual assistants for a wide array of application domains.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="quinde_software_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Software Architecture Proposal for a Data Platform on Active Mobility and Urban Environment</div> <div class="author"> Christian Quinde, David Guillermo, Lorena Siguenza-Guzman, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

Consequently, characteristics such as availability, scalability, interoperability, and failure handling have become essential. Due to the vast diversity of applications and user levels, and the growing complexity of data types and models handling geospatial data, information management has developed into a complex, often overlooked task, leading to delayed results and/or disorganization of information. The goal of this paper is to propose a software architecture design to support mobility data collection, analysis, and visualization. The proposal is based on the process for software architectures stated by Bredemeyer Consulting, comprising five stages: commit, requirements, design, validation, and deployment. Likewise, the Attribute Driven Design (ADD) method has been used for the design stage where the selected architectural pattern was Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) since it provides the scalability and interoperability attributes required for this study. The Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) has been chosen to identify the risks of the proposal and to evaluate the architecture to ensure that all requirements have been satisfactorily met. The model was validated using the data and projects of the LlactaLAB research group.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="sigua_proposal_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Proposal for the Design and Evaluation of a Dashboard for the Analysis of Learner Behavior and Dropout Prediction in Moodle</div> <div class="author"> Edisson Sigua, Bryan Aguilar, Paola Pesántez-Cabrera, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

With the support of modern technology, virtual platforms that encourage the adoption of a new learning paradigm in which geographical/temporal limitations no longer pose a difficulty have been developed and refined. These virtual learning platforms, also known as Learning Management Systems (LMS), store student and teacher interactions with course resources, and these interactions are stored in database engines. However, all the information generated by LMS has not been processed in a way that is helpful for the use of teachers and students, mainly because in most cases, students’ interactions with these systems focus on downloading class material, delivering assignments, and reading announcements, leaving aside indicators that can be presented in the form of visualizations that allow actions to be taken during the development of the learning process. Thus, this study proposes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a dashboard for the analysis of learner behavior and prediction of dropout on the Moodle platform. The proposed tool will help students to manage their learning process, easily and effectively monitor their progress in an online course, and teachers to know what students do before, during and after a virtual class. The latter for the purpose of being able to detect early students at risk of dropping out.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="cabrera_towards_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Towards a Methodology for creating Internet of Things (IoT) Applications based on Microservices</div> <div class="author"> Edwin Cabrera, Paola Cárdenas, Priscila Cedillo, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

On the other hand, microservices architectures have broken the monolithic and centralized way to build software, and provide systems with high-quality characteristics (e.g., resilience, availability, modularity, and portability). Therefore, the idea of merging those technologies can constitute a powerful strategy to be applied in environments that demand the distribution and management of many IoT devices using high-quality software. In this context, several studies that integrate IoT with microservices solutions have been analyzed. However, most of these studies aim to satisfy the functional requirements related to software and hardware, without taking into account software engineering methodologies and good practices that allow the creation of software for IoT devices considering their distributed nature. Thus, this paper presents the first approach to an agile methodology that i) contemplates the main characteristics of the IoT and ii) guides the development of appropriate software solutions based on microservices architectures to manage IoT environments acknowledging the serious difficulties that microservices imply.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="pesantez-cabrera_towards_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Towards an evaluation method of how accessible serious games are to older adults</div> <div class="author"> Paola Pesántez-Cabrera, María Inés Acosta, Verónica Jimbo, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

Guidance on how to coordinate the interaction between the LA policymaking and implementation is mostly missing, leaving a difficult challenge up to practitioners. In this study we propose a coordination model to support future LA initiatives at scale. We explore the problem by comparing two cases in Belgium and Ecuador. Following up we use the LA implementation timeline as a driver for planning the interaction between the policymaking and implementation. We continue by testing an application of the model with LA experts predominantly from Latin-American institutions, asking them to map low-level items of the SHEILA policy framework to four implementation phases. The results of this mapping support that LA policy building can be spread over time, that it can coincide with LA implementation at scale, and that both efforts can be coordinated. It is hoped that this study will provide additional guidance for future Latin-American and other LA initiatives.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="hilliger_towards_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Towards learning analytics adoption: A mixed methods study of data-related practices and policies in Latin American universities</div> <div class="author"> Isabel Hilliger, Margarita Ortiz-Rojas, Paola Pesántez-Cabrera, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 7 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '7 more authors' ?

In order to get a better picture of how existing data-related practices and policies might affect the incorporation of LA in Latin American institutions, we conducted a mixed methods study in four Latin American universities (two Chilean and two Ecuadorian). In this paper, the qualitative data were based on 37 interviews with managers and 16 focus groups with 51 teaching staff and 45 students; the quantitative data were collected through two surveys answered by 1884 students and 368 teachers, respectively. The findings reveal opportunities to incorporate LA services into existing data practices in the four case studies.

In this paper, we address the problem of identifying communities from biological bipartite networks - i.e., networks where interactions are observed between two different types of objects (e.g., genes and diseases, drugs and protein complexes, plants and pollinators, and hosts and pathogens). Toward detecting communities in such bipartite networks, we make the following contributions: i) (metric) we propose a variant of bipartite modularity; ii) (algorithms) we present an efficient algorithm called biLouvain that implements a set of heuristics toward fast and precise community detection in bipartite networks (https://github.com/paolapesantez/biLouvain); and iii) (experiments) we present a thorough experimental evaluation of our algorithm including comparison to other state-of-the-art methods to identify communities in bipartite networks. Experimental results show that our biLouvain algorithm identifies communities that have a comparable or better quality (as measured by bipartite modularity) than existing methods, while significantly reducing the time-to-solution between one and four orders of magnitude.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="hilliger_assessing_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Assessing Institutional Needs for Learning Analytics Adoption in Latin American Higher Education</div> <div class="author"> Isabel Hilliger, Mar Pérez-Sanagustín, Margarita Ortiz, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 7 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '7 more authors' ?

So far, most studies in LA have concentrated on the development of tools to address educational challenges in the contexts of Europe, Australia, and U.S. However, tools and adoption frameworks developed in these contexts are not necessarily applicable for higher education institutions in the rest of the world. Given that there is no one-size-fits-all approach, this study aims to assess institutional needs for LA in the Latin American context by collecting and analyzing qualitative information obtained from managers, teaching staff and students at four universities (U1, U2, U3, and U4). Although most participants agreed that LA is a promising means to monitor students’ academic progress at a curriculum level, findings show specific needs and considerations that differentiate each university (U1: academic support for subgroups, U2: dropout indicators,</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="pesantez-cabrera_exploiting_2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Exploiting Intra-Type Information in Bipartite Community Detection</div> <div class="author"> Paola Pesántez-Cabrera, Ananth Kalyanaraman, and Mahantesh Halappanavar</div> <div class="periodical"> Jul 2018 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Classical bipartite community methods only take into account inter-type edge information-i.e., edges between vertices of two different types.

It differs from a traditional link prediction task in that the links in a knowledge graph are categorized into different predicates and the link prediction performance of different predicates in a knowledge graph generally varies widely. In this work, we propose a latent feature embedding based link prediction model which considers the prediction task for each predicate disjointly. To learn the model parameters it utilizes a Bayesian personalized ranking based optimization technique. Experimental results on large-scale knowledge bases such as YAGO2 show that our link prediction approach achieves substantially higher performance than several state-of-art approaches. We also show that for a given predicate the topological properties of the knowledge graph induced by the given predicate edges are key indicators of the link prediction performance of that predicate in the knowledge graph.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="pesantez-cabrera_kinetic_2016" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Kinetic Model of Development and Aging of Artificial Skin Based on Analysis of Microscopy Data</div> <div class="author"> Paola Pesantez-Cabrera, Cläre von Neubeck, Marianne B.

In this chapter, we show how modeling can integrate microscopy data to obtain a better understanding of the development and aging of artificial human skin. We use the time-dependent structural information predicted by our model to show how irradiation with an electron beam at different times in the life of artificial human skin affects the amount of energy deposited in different layers of the tissue. Experimental studies of this type will enable a better understanding of how different cell types in human skin contribute to overall tissue response to ionizing radiation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="pesantez-cabrera_detecting_2016" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Detecting Communities in Biological Bipartite Networks</div> <div class="author"> Paola Pesantez-Cabrera, and Ananth Kalyanaraman</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 7th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics</em> Oct 2016 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Methods to uncover and extract community structures are required in a number of biological applications where networked data and their interactions can be modeled as graphs, and observing tightly-knit groups of vertices ("communities") can offer insights into the structural and functional building blocks of the underlying network. While classical applications of community detection have focused largely on detecting molecular complexes from protein-protein networks and other similar graphs, there is an increasing need for extending the community detection operation to work for heterogeneous data sets — i.e., networks built out of multiple types of data. In this paper, we address the problem of identifying communities from biological bipartite networks — networks where interactions are observed between two different types of vertices (e.g., genes and diseases, drugs and protein complexes, plants and pollinators). Toward detecting communities in such bipartite networks, we make the following contributions: i) we define a variant of the bipartite modularity function defined by Murata to overcome one of its limitations; ii) we present an algorithm (biLouvain), building on an efficient heuristic that was originally developed for unipartite networks; and iii) we present a thorough experimental evaluation of our algorithm compared to other state-of-the-art methods to identify communities on bipartite networks. Experimental results show that our biLouvain algorithm identifies communities that have a comparable or better quality (bipartite modularity) than existing methods, while significantly reducing the time-to-solution between one and three orders of magnitude.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2022 Paola Pesantez-Cabrera.
